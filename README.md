# g--

g-- is a compiler for the C-- language, which is basically shitty C without half the features (my man C got nerfed).
This compiler is written in C++ using LLVM. It is more of a way for me and v22 to practice using LLVM in an easier language before we start working on coby again, since we want to do coby well (as I plan for it to be an actual language I release).

hopefully we finish C-- soon... enjoy (you can compile it with the makefile, and install it to /usr/local/bin on mac and linux using make install)

If you can make some libraries for things in this I will be really impressed, or just mess around idk.
